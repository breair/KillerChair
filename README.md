An **Android** timer app designed to control your sitting time.

## Why?
Have you ever thought about how much downtime many of us give to our legs? All those hours in the day spent behind a desk, followed by a good nights rest, certainly adds up.Sitting is comfortable, but its limiting.
Humans are built to stand upright. Your heart and cardiovascular system work more effectively that way.When you are physically active your overall energy levels and endurance improve, and your bones maintain strength.
